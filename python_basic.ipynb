        "It is popular because  it  used for a variety of tasks, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.\n",

        "2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that the Python interpreter recognizes and uses for specific functionality. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names) because they have a special meaning in the language. Examples include: if, else, while, try, for, class, import, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. They are reserved for the language’s syntax and have a predefined role in the program. Trying to use a keyword as a variable name will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Mutability refers to whether or not an object’s state can be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can have their values changed, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements after they’ve been created (e.g., append, remove, or change items).\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. This is because tuples are often used for fixed collections of data, providing a guarantee that their values will not change.\n",
        "\n",
        "7)What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "== checks if the values of two objects are the same. It compares the data or content inside the objects.\n",
        "is checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. It compares the memory address, not the content.\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = a\n",
        "print(a == b)  # True (content is the same)\n",
        "print(a is b)  # True (both refer to the same object)\n",
        "\n",
        "8)What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return a boolean result. In Python, the main logical operators are:\n",
        "\n",
        "and: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "or: Returns True if at least one of the conditions is true.\n",
        "not: Reverses the result, returns True if the condition is false, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "9)What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another. Python provides functions like int(), float(), str(), etc., to convert between types.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "x = \"123\"\n",
        "y = int(x)  # Convert string to integer\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "Implicit type casting (also called type coercion) is when Python automatically converts one data type to another. For example, if you add an integer and a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit type casting is when the programmer manually converts one type to another using functions like int(), float(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Conditional statements are used to make decisions in your code. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition (or multiple conditions) are True or False. The most common conditional statements are if, elif, and else.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "elif stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions after the initial if. If the if condition is False, it checks the elif conditions one by one. If none of them are True, it defaults to the else block (if provided).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "x = 20\n",
        "if x < 10:\n",
        "    print(\"x is less than 10\")\n",
        "elif x < 30:\n",
        "    print(\"x is less than 30\")  # This will be printed\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"x is 30 or more\")\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and automatically stops when the sequence is exhausted.\n",
        "\n",
        "for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4\n",
        "\n",
        "while loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains True. It requires manual management of the condition (e.g., incrementing a counter).\n",
        "\n",
        "i = 0\n",
        "while i < 5:\n",
        "    print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4\n",
        "    i += 1\n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know how many iterations you’ll need beforehand and the loop should continue until a certain condition is met."
